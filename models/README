The notedooks of three different architectures.

The project uses labeled images and compares three types of architectures, 
including Yolo, RetinaNet, and Faster R-CNN, to propose the best model for detecting targets in Navantia. 

The main reasons behind our selected models are:
1. YOLO is a fast and accurate model that can handle large and imbalanced datasets, making it suitable for real-time applications. 
2. Faster R-CNN is a two-stage model that is accurate and suitable for detecting objects in complex scenes with a low false-positive rate.
3. RetinaNet is a single-stage model with a focal loss function and fast processing, making it suitable for real-time tasks. 

The objective is to achieve an accurate deployment model and experiment with different architectures for optimization.
